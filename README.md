### Field Mapping Guide

To ensure correct data mapping in your Excel files, you need to use the exact field names from Odoo. Here's how to find the correct field names:

1. Enable Developer Mode in Odoo:
   - Go to Settings
   - Scroll to the bottom of the page
   - Click "Activate Developer Mode"

2. Find Field Names:
   - Navigate to the model you want to work with (e.g., Contacts, Products)
   - Click the "Bug" icon (üêû) in the top menu bar
   - Select "View Fields"
   - You'll see a list showing:
     - Field names (use these in your Excel headers)
     - Field types (char, integer, many2one, etc.)
     - Required fields (marked with *)
     - Field descriptions and constraints

Make sure your Excel file headers match the Odoo field names exactly.

## Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 400: Invalid request (wrong file type, missing data)
- 500: Server error (Odoo connection issues, processing errors)

## Response Format

Successful import response:
```json
{
    "message": "Successfully imported X records",
    "record_ids": [1, 2, 3],
    "verified_records": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Record name",
            "create_date": "2025-05-17 10:00:00"
        }
    ]
}
```
